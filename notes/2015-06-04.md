## Homework

Article IV, Sessions 19 and 20

## Discussion

We first covered the same material we did last time (free categories
and reflexive graphs).

We notedt that Awodey defines reflexive graphs such that `i(v) = v`
for some vertex; we believe this is identical to the definition of `i`
as a retraction for both `s` and `t` and are uncertain of why it was
presented in such an opaque way.

We also pondered what 'free' means. Awodey defines it once and for all
in the chapter on adjoints, which is how Haskellers talk about it too,
so we'll postpone a rigorous definition of freedom until then.

## Newcomers

We have some newcomers! They can catch up by reading Articles I/II/III
in the red book, but Jack had a great idea. They can just read the
first chapter in Awodey (much shorter) first. It'll equip newcomers
with the vocabulary to ask us questions and bring them up to speed for
reading the same sessions the old-timers are reading now.
