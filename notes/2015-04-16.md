## Homework

Same as last week.

* Article 2, Section 10
* Article 3, Section 11
* Article 3, Section 12
* Article 3, Section 13

Attempt to do all exercises from Section 10, as they are challenging and rewarding.

## What are inclusion maps?

An inclusion map is a map `f : A -> B` such that `f(x) = x` for all x (implying, of course, that A is a subset of B). [For a more thorough discussion, consult your local massive online collaborative encyclopedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_map)

## Article 2, Section 10, Exercise 1

This was the bulk of the discussion this week.

Earlier in the article we proved this theorem:

> Fix an inclusion map `f: DB -> D` from a disk's boundary to a disk. Assume there is no continuous `g : D -> DB` such that `gf = 1` â€“ this intuitively makes sense, as it would seem very difficult to 'pack' a disk's boundary into a disk without losing information along the way. (The disk's boundary has 'less room' than the disk itself.) Then, I assert that every continuous endomap on the disk has a fixed point.

What does it mean for a continuous endomap on the disk to have a fixed point? Well, take a map of NYC. Crumple the map. Place the map on your NYC apartment floor. Then there's always a point on the crumpled map in the exact place where the map indicates it should be, in actual NYC.

OK so that's not that interesting. This is more of a mathematical curiosity than antyhing.

Proof of theorem: suppose for a contradiction that no continuous endomap on the disk has a fixed point. We will show that this is a startlingly strong assertion, and leads to a contradiction of our assumptions.

Fix `e : D -> D` to be some endomap on the disk. We will construct a continuous `g : D -> DB` such that `gf` = `1`.

Fix a point `p` on the disk. What should `g(p)` equal, in order for `g(f(p)) = p`?

All we know is that `g(p) != p`. Therefore, we can construct a ray from `g(p)` to `p`. Let `g(p)` be intersection of this ray with `DB`.

We now need to discharge the following lemmas:

* `g(p)` is defined for all `p` in the domain `DB`. This is true, by definition.

* `
