No Awodey. (Optionally read over free monoids/categories and locally-small categories; Jack and Hao would love to talk about them with you. We'll hit free categories in the future when we cover universal mapping properties, maybe.)

## Article 2, Quiz #2*

Let `q' = qpq`. (I'm going to mean `ab` as `a` compose `b` here.) Then `q'pq' = qpqpqpq = q(pqp)qpq = qpqpq = q(pqp)q = qpq = q'`, by the given that `pqp = p`. The other equation follows similarly.

## Article 2, Quiz #1*

Choose A and B to be the natural numbers and real numbers. Then there can be no map between them with both a retraction and a section, as that would violate Cantor's diagonal argument.

Simpler: `[1, infinity]` and `[0, infinity]`. Pick the map `f` to be `f(x) = x`. (You can pick a map in this problem.)

## Article 2, Summary on pairs of opposed maps

This section was confusing and has multiple answers per blank.

Q3 can be solved by knowing that if `f` is an isomorphism, then there exists exactly one inverse.

Q2 has too many blanks, but is probably quizzing the knowledge that `f . f = 1` is the definition of an involution?

## (Awodey now) Logical deductions form a category

This is from first-order logic. Let `C` be the category where the objects are all formulas and an arrow exists between `a, b` iff `a` implies `b`. As logical implication is transitive, this is a well-defined category. The identity arrow is `p`-implies-`p`, which is a tautology.

## Cayley's theorem, explained

The book, especially the PDF, does a poor job of explaining what this is.

The goal is this: given any category where the arrows 'fit' into a set (more on this later), can we construct an isomorphic category where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions? The answer is yes, and it's 'Cayley's theorem' (although really it's merely analogous to Cayley's theorem for group decompositions and has nothing to do with Cayley himself).

### Motivation

Why is it important that we can do this at all? Because category theory is richer than set theory. Some categories that we encounter will have non-set objects. For example the `3` category: the objects are {A, B, C} and the arrows are {A --> B, A --> C, B --> C}. We know nothing about this category's objects and arrows besides where the arrows start and end, and yet this theorem says there exists a category out there (isomorphic to this one) where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions.

We'd like to then divide categories into those that can be represented as sets and functions, and those that cannot. What are the necessary requirements? What are the sufficient requirements?

### Proof (construction)

The proof is by construction. Fix any category `Abstract`. We will construct a new category `Concrete` whose objects are sets and whose arrows are functions between the sets. (We'll get back to these names later.)

* Here is a function `f` that maps any object in `Abstract` to a set of arrows pointing to it, in `Abstract`.

      # f(o) is shorthand for "all the arrows pointing to o"
      f(o) = { cod(f) == o for f in arrows(Abstract) }

  * For every object `o` in `Abstract`, let `f(o)` be an object of `Concrete`.

* Arrows are more complicated. An arrow `a` in `Abstract` is an arrow from one object `s` to one object `t`. Is there a corresponding arrow in `Concrete` from `f(s)` (a set of arrows from `Abstract`) to `f(t)` (another set of Arrows from `Abstract`)?

  * Yes, this function.

        fs2ft(any arrow pointing to s) = a . (any arrow pointing to s)
        
  * Since `a` has 'type' `s -> t`, `a . (any arrow pointing to s)` must have 'type' `any arrow pointing to s -> any arrow pointing to t`, or `f(s) -> f(t)`. As required.

We have the objects and arrows of `Concrete` now; the objects are indeed sets, and the arrows are indeed functions.

### Proof (construction is sufficient)

* The arrows of `Concrete` compose, have an identity, obey associativity, and obey unit. This is not too hard to do, as the arrows are functions -- familiar territory.

* Prove that our correspondences form a functor `F`, which would be a combination of `f` (the object mapping) and `g(s -> t) = fs2ft` (the arrow mapping).

  * Prove `F(a : s -> t) = F(f): F(s) -> F(t)`, which we hand-waved above.

  * Prove `F(g . f) = F(g) . F(f)`, which is left to you.

  * Prove `F(1_Abstract) = 1_Concrete`.

* Prove that there exists `F inverse` going back. This is tedious but not difficult; `f` is surjective by definition and is injective because two objects `a, b` in `Abstract` can _never_ cause `f(a) = f(b)`; `g` follows similarly.

All that work done, we can show that `F` is an isomorphism between `Abstract` and `Concrete` in the category `Cat` (the categories of categories, where arrows are functors).

## Abstract vs. concrete

This remark is potent:

> This shows us what is wrong with the naive notion of a “concrete”
> category of sets and functions: while not every category has special
> sets and functions as its objects and arrows, every category is
> isomorphic to such a one. Thus, the only special properties such
> categories can possess are ones that are categorically irrelevant,
> such as features of the objects that do not affect the arrows in any
> way (like the difference between the real numbers constructed as
> Dedekind cuts or as Cauchy sequences).

We can say that concrete categories are just categories where objects
are sets and arrows are functions, but we would be _wrong_: many (but
not all! the arrows have to 'fit' into a set) categories that do not
obey these two rules are isomorphic to a category that _does_ obey
these two rules, thanks to this Cayley-esque theorem.

So we need a better definition:

> A better attempt to capture what is intended by the rather vague
> idea of a “concrete” category is that arbitrary arrows f : C → D are
> completely determined by their composites with arrows x : T → C from
> some “test object” T in the sense that fx = gx for all such x
> implies f = g.

An arrow can be thought of not by which object it starts from and
which object it ends at, but instead by what happens _when you compose
it with all the other arrows in the category_ (whose domain is the
arrow's codomain, so that composition is possible). This is exactly
what we did in our proof: for a given abstract arrow `a : s -> t`, we
constructed the concrete arrow `f2sf2t` that composed every other
possible arrow with `a`.

(`a` is the `f : C -> D` here. Unlike the proof, they're fixing a test
object `T` and not considering all the other arrows in the object.)

> This amounts to considering a particular representation of the
> category, determined by T. A category is then said to be “concrete”
> when this condition holds for T a “terminal object,” in the sense of
> Section 2.2; but there are also good reasons for considering other
> objects T, as we see in the next chapter.

Discussion postponed until we run into terminal objects.

## Example: 3

The objects are {A, B, C} and the arrows are {A --> B, A --> C, B --> C}.

Then `f(A) = {}, f(B) = {A --> B}, f(C) = {A --> C, B --> C}`.

Then `g(a2b : A --> B) = \(x2a : X -> A) -> a2b . x2a = {}`.

Then `g(a2c : A --> C) = \(x2a : X -> A) -> a2c . x2a = {}`.

Then `g(b2c : B --> C) = \(x2b : X -> B) -> b2c . x2b = { (A --> B, A --> C) }`.

This looks like this:

![3 and 3-bar](https://i.imgur.com/D7lh6Ws.jpg)

Verify for yourself that `3-bar` (the concrete version of `3`) is indeed a category, that there indeed exists a functor from `3` to `3-bar`, and that there indeed exists a functor from `3-bar` to `3`.
