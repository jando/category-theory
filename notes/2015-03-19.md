* Book structure: articles pose a question, sessions in each article dive into the questions
* Homework: read article I and write down questions if any arise; otherwise we're going to skip past this for time
* Homework: read article II, sections 4 and 5, and write down questions if any arise
  * Food for thought: how would you explain determination and choice?
  * What are sections and retractions? Why are they so whimsically named?
  * Do some homework questions; bring one that you think might be fun to do
* Discussion
  * Arrows vs. functions / "put the arrows first": unlike sets, sometimes the category itself might not contain any "data" and instead it's the arrows that model the idea you're thinking about
  * Concrete example: the monoid of integers under addition is a category with a dummy element, and the arrows are (+0), (+1), (-1), (+2), (-2), ...
  * Maps vs. functions: they're synonyms (see page 14 or thereabouts)
  * Pick's formula: a determination problem found in the book
    * Consider polygons whose vertices are on a grid
    * These vertices then always have integer Cartesian coordinates
    * If these polygons map to (#interior points, #exterior points) and polygons map to an area, is there a mapping from (#exterior, #interior) to interior?
    * Yes! interior + (1/2 exterior) - 1
    * For proof, see Wikipedia -- it's induction
    * Simpler theorem, also inductive: every polygon in a square grid of dots has an area that is a whole multiple of 1/2

  * Alternative book, read by Jack: Category Theory (recommended by Jack and Edward Kmett)
