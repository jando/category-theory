## Homework

Read the rest of Article 3, quizzes tests and whatnot.

## Article 3, Session 17, Exercise 1

Here are six graphs, as defined by their arrows:

```
A = { a -> a }
B = { a } (no edges)
C = { a -> c, b -> c, c -> d, e -> d }
D = { a -> b, b -> a }
E = { a -> b, a -> b }
F = { b -> a, c }
```

The free category of a graph is the following category:

* For each vertex `v` in the graph, let `v` be an object in the category (simple enough)
* For each _path_ (not edge) from `v` to `w` in the graph, let `v -> w` be an arrow in the category

Careful to not have an off-by-one error in the second requirement. 'Path' in graph theory can have zero length, so every vertex automatically has a path to itself. Which means every object in the category automatically has an identity arrow. This caveat is not made clear at all in the exercise, but is discussed in Session 17.

We also have not yet defined terminal objects:

> (Session 19) In a category `C`, an object `t` is a terminal object iff the following is true: for every object `x \in C` there is exactly one arrow from `x` to `t`.

We thus conclude that the following categories have terminal objects:

* `A`: `a` has two paths to `a`, violating the uniqueness constraint
* `B`: `a` has exacty one path to `a`, so `a` is terminal
* `C`: every vertex has exactly one path to `d`
* `D`: both vertices have multiple paths to themselves â€“ no terminal
* `E`: no terminal
* `F`: no terminal

(This might have errors. I have a hazy recollection of this meeting at best.)
